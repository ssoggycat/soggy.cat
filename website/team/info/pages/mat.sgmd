Hello! i'm {mat}{she/her.. i haven't picked a better name yet :sog: :sog:🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️}! what you just read was cv's writing on me for this page, which i thought was accurate but pretty barren.
To add to this page, and to simplify my work with ssoggycat into a list:
- I do 65%-ish of the whole brand management thing for ssoggycat
-# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 30% is interacting with people on twitter, and the other 35% is 3D renders
-# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and if you're not blind, you've seen at least one 🐈🐈🐈
- I host a server for myself, but it gets most of its traffic from ssoggycat!
- And I make sure the code written for these websites is consistent!
-# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or to say it in a more realistic way: im the janitor :beast:
-# &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i'll be honest. with how much work i've done on this very page i might just be layout-panel-right

I don't have much else to add,
but if you like this page and have some ideas: feel free to fork the website and send in stuff as a pull request!
if you like this page but DON'T have ideas. feel free to [donate](https://soggy.cat/donate/)
