that's me, the current [ssoggycat](https://x.com/ssoggycat) and [soggy world](https://discord.gg/soggycat) owner!!  uh.. i don't really know what to write about myself
<br>
i make random edits and do some minor programming, not much else. i'm not very active on the internet, i mostly just procrastinate and lose my mind
<br>
-# LORE???

if i remember correctly, i discovered soggy world through the unofficial [@discord soggy](https://x.com/discord_soggy) account on twitter, and used it to share soggy.cat (this domain) with my friend group to the rest of the server, and ktg thought it was really cool.
<br>
i've been slowly growing more active and got verified, then when ktg needed more mods i became a mod and then an admin. since ktg was planning on leaving, he transferred ownership to me as he deemed me the most dedicated person in the community.
my very first message on the server was shilling a [whole website we made for shark](https://soggy.cat), which serves the subdomain you're on right now, so i get where that would be coming from..
<br>
time is a blur, but i'm sure you can reconstruct the timeline in detail from my cringy messages!!
i've been thinking of transferring ownership to #mat#(mat) for a while now, as i've also become a bit undedicated to the art of shark but she doesn't want to take the role for now. so, uh, i'm still _"the soggy cat guy"_ until further notice
